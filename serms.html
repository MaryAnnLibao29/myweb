            <h3>"BE STILL"</h3>
	 <div class="description-design">
	      <p>Sunday Service </p>
	      <p>November 8, 2020</p>
	      <p>Psalm 46:10</p>
          </div>
        
<p>-Still means free from turbulence or commotion. Calmness or silence. At peace.</p> 
<br>
<p>What situation are we to BE STILL?</p>
 
<p>1. When you feel like GOD IS NOT ANSWERING YOU PRAYERS!</p>
<p>(Jeremiah 29:12-13)</p>
	<p>The plans of the Lord is always better than what you have in mind. He prepared greater things in our life but sometimes we can't understand.</p> 
	<p>He knows every detail in your life so stop doubting the Love of God. </p>
	<p>God will never dissapoint you. God knows what your heart truly needs and he 
	will give you the best in life and you will experience the greatness of your love.</p> 
	<p>When he says 'No' it simply means he is preparing something better for you. 
	When he says 'Wait' he is preparing you for the blessings. Then you will realize that everything 'Worth it'.</p> 
	<br>

<p>2. When you GO THROUGH BROKENNESS!</p>
	<p>(Psalm 147:3)</p>
	<p>God can send a broken hearts. He can heal the wounds inside.</p> 
	<p>God can do impossible things. He can perform miracles in your life. He will restore your past.</p> 
	<p>You can't change it. But God turn it into powerful testimonies.</p> 
	<p>He just want us to grow and mature.</p> 
	<p>Brokenness can save you. He doesn't want to hurt you. He doesn't want to destroyer your life. His ways are just mysterious.</p> 
	<p>Learn to endure and keep your faith. </p>
	<br>

<p>3. When you SUFFER SICKNESSES!</p>
<p>We suffer sicknesses because of self abuse.</p>  
<p>Because of abundance we are having so much food as if there's no more tomorrow. And at the end we might regret.</p>  
<p>God loves us. He is our great healer. Always ask God in prayer to heal you.</p> 
<p>God corrects us when we suffer all these.</p>  
<p>God heals inside. He heals our heart. He is the greatest surgeon.</p> 
<p>What we need is the assurance that God is with you no matter what happens.</p> 
<p>God is the best doctor. </p>
<br>

<p>4. When you are OUT OF STOCK!</p>
<p>(Eccleciastes 3:11, Phillipians 4:19)</p>
<p>When everything we need is run out, learn to endure and keep your faith.</p> 
<p>God will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</p> 
<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn your complaints into worship and you will feel so relieved inside. 
Make Him not only your priority but make God the center of your life and everything else will follow. 
Fot He has made everything beautiful in his time. He also set eternity to the human heart yet no one can do what God has done from beginning to end.
So stop worrying, instead Lift up all your burdens to God and surrender everything to Him.</p> 
<br>
<p>To God be the Glory! God Bless Us All!</p>
