            <h3>The Story of the Blessed Church</h3>
            <p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in the year 1958 when Bro. Victor Valdez and Ptr. Balbino Batara both a product of 
		Badoc, Ilocs Norte who were converted into a Pentecostal faith in Hawaii came to their hometown to share the blessing of salvation.
		Their ministry was followed with signs and wonders that any lives were converted and transformed and many followed the Lord Jesus.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early believers of the Lord gathered themselves in their first services in a big house own by one of the relative of Ptr. Batara. 
		When Bro. Victor Valdez and Ptr. Balbino Batara returned to Hawaii the believers of Lubigan needs someone to shepherd them. 
		It was Ptr. Leonida Callejo Leones together with some members of San Pedro Church continued the pioneered work.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of believers grew rapidly because of the manifestation and the wonderful working power of God. The gospel of the Lord burst 
		like a dynamite that spreads throughout the neighboring barangays of Lubigan. Because of the growng numbers of believers, 
		they decided themselves to put up a building or a house of worship. It was thru the financial support of Ptr. Balbino Batara together 
		with the sacrifices of the members that their plan came true.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that period of years since the start it's not been always fine and good because big trials, hardships, problems came also to 
		shake the faith of the church. The devil tries to destroy the church there were even divisions but as Christ declared, "Upon this rock 
.		I will built my church that the gates of hell and hades shall not prevail againts it'. To God be the Glory, the Church of Lubigan had 
		gone thru many fiery trials and tsunami but Praise God until today the church is still standing. We are what we are because of His 
		great love and grace.
